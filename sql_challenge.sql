USE sakila;

#1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

#1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. 
#Name the column `Actor Name`
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS "Actor Name" FROM actor;

#2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know 
#only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT actor_id FROM actor WHERE first_name = "Joe";

#2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE last_name LIKE "%GEN%";

#2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`
#This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT last_name,first_name FROM actor WHERE last_name LIKE "%LI%";

#2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: 
#Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id,country FROM country WHERE country IN ("Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "China");

#3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries
#on a description, so create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data 
#type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`, as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` 
#are significant).
ALTER TABLE actor
ADD COLUMN description BLOB;
SELECT * FROM actor;

#3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. 
#Delete the `description` column.
ALTER TABLE actor DROP description;
SELECT * FROM actor;

#4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) FROM actor GROUP BY last_name;

#4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, 
#but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) FROM actor GROUP BY last_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

#4c. The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as 
#`GROUCHO WILLIAMS`. Write a query to fix the record.
UPDATE sakila.actor
SET first_name = 'HARPO',
	last_update = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE UPPER(last_name) = 'WILLIAMS'
	AND UPPER(first_name) = 'GROUCHO';

#4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` 
#was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently 
#`HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.
UPDATE sakila.actor
SET first_name = 'GROUCHO',
	last_update = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()

#5a. You cannot locate the schema of the `address` table. Which query would you use to re-create 
#it?
SHOW CREATE TABLE sakila.address;

#6a. Use `JOIN` to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. 
#Use the tables `staff` and `address`:

JOIN sakila.address a
ON s.address_id = a.address_id;

#6b. Use `JOIN` to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. 
#Use tables `staff` and `payment`.

#6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables `film_actor` 
#and `film`. Use inner join.

WHERE UPPER(f.title) = 'HUNCHBACK IMPOSSIBLE';

#6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each 
#customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:
SELECT UPPER(c.last_name) AS Customer_Name, sum(p.amount)
FROM sakila.customer c

#7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence.

#7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. (**Hint**: you may need to use the
